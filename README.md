Can hardly code... but he's trying his best.

I don't do much here but what I do is mainly:
- Web stuff, not sure why. Guess it's fun.
- C# and .NET, because a job would be nice.
- Python, like drugs it's fun and everyone else is doing it.
- Hardware, 1s and 0s in the real world!

But umm yeah enjoy the like three things that are public!
